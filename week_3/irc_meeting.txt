09:42	mouse	I'm still working on setting up my dev environment. I'm hoping to have it up today by either setting up a different vm or trying on that same linux machine a few more times...
09:43	duck	I also have linux finally dual booted on my machine after much trial and error. 
09:43	frog	mouse we had a lot of success with dualbooting from a USB that was burned with Rufus
09:43	duck	i also have git and mercurial installed, but that's it.
09:43	duck	yes Rufus is what seemed to make the difference

09:44	FishBoi	anyone finish this weeks blog?
09:44	mouse	I just can update my remote branch because I'm missing some C libraries inside linux to make the git-cinnabar helper
09:45	frog	weird
09:45	mouse	I just "can't" update my remote branch because I'm missing some C libraries inside linux to make the git-cinnabar helper
09:45	mouse	That's why I want to try on something else like ubuntu. 
09:47	mouse	I still haven't done anything for my blog
