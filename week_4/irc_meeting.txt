09:38		*** zookeeper joined #CS435zoo
09:38	FishBoi	This week I have finished installing the Dev Tools environment on my duel booted machine
09:39	frog	(zookeeper is my bot I am playing with)
09:39	mouse	Well I've set up my environment but still no luck finding a bug to fix.
09:39	duck	This last week, I finished getting my Linux environment, finished installing the DevTools, ran a practice example that didn't really help, and tried, unsuccessfully, to find a bug to work on.
09:40	frog	This week, I messed around with supybot just to see if I could get it to work, I got my linux dual boot working fully, and did the devtools and tutorials. Still looking for a bug as well.
09:40	mouse	I don't know that we'll find an extremely easy bug to fix so maybe we should just pick something....??
09:41	FishBoi	Theres not a lot of first time bugs that are available or unclaimed at the moment, is what I noticed 
09:41	FishBoi	I agree
09:42	duck	yeah, I guess
09:42	mouse	It's the submission that she grades so we just work on it as any open source developer would and that's all we can do I think?
09:42	frog	okay
09:42	mouse	Don't sound so enthusiastic there duck
09:43	FishBoi	yeah as long as we take screen shots for everything we find useful or share with other, she said that would count
09:44	mouse	okay, so we each one of us propose a bug by tomorrow evening or Sunday evening?
09:45	FishBoi	I think that would be do able
09:45	duck	Sounds good to me
09:45	frog	how are we going to do that? should we have another meeting later?
09:45	mouse	we can text the bug number
09:46	FishBoi	concure
09:47	frog	ah okay
09:47	mouse	Should we continue with what we are going to do?
09:47	FishBoi	I think that would be best
09:48	FishBoi	I plan on writing my week four blog by Sunday and seeking out a bug we could possibly work on
09:49	frog	I plan on writing my blog and looking for a bug more closely
09:49	duck	I'm going to search for bugs to fix (finished blog just now)
09:49	mouse	okay, so I haven't written my blog yet, as always. I will probably get to it by 11:00 PM Sunday as usual and I will look for a bug to propose hopefully by tomorrow night.
09:51	mouse	I realized that I'm not a big fan of working on my laptop at all.
09:51	FishBoi	neato, should we go into what obstacles may be slowing us from completing tasks? 
09:52	mouse	I don't think I have anything that'll slow me down besides deciding on what bug to propose. 
09:52	frog	~senior project~
09:53	duck	*shhh*
09:53	FishBoi	haha other classes (mostly senior project) 
09:53	mouse	yeah that's a given....
09:53	duck	honestly, I think an obstacle is going to be not even know how difficult a bug might be
09:54	frog	yeah
09:54	FishBoi	concure
09:54	mouse	that could be with any bug. I could seem easy but digging into one might reveal that it isn't easy at all.
09:55	mouse	It could seem ...
09:55	FishBoi	I think your right
09:56	mouse	anything else?
09:56	frog	I don't think so. How long are these meeting supposed to take again?
09:56	mouse	30 min
09:56	mouse	30 hours!
09:57	mouse	in mouse time
09:57	frog	mouse have their own time??
09:57	frog	*mice
09:58	frog	jesus
09:58	mouse	yeah man!
09:58	FishBoi	should we end if we have nothing else to say
09:58	mouse	sounds good to me.
09:58	frog	sure
09:59	mouse	duck?
09:59	frog	FishBoi are you going to copy the chat?
09:59	duck	bye
