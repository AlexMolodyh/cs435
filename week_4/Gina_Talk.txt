Hi Gina,

I wanted to thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule and passing on some of your knowledge in open source licensing to us. I'm looking to join the Kotlin open source project in the near future so any insight into any part of open source is a great benefit to me so on bahalf of myself and the CS435 class at Western Oregon University, Thank You!
