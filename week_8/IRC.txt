12:05	frog	hey there
12:05	frog	sorry about the delay, we were messing with the wifi at our house and only tested it on our phones, not with our laptops
12:07	mouse	sup, it's all good...
12:08	frog	fish should be on soon
12:08	mouse	Awesome.
12:08		*** FishBoi joined #CS435zoo
12:09	FishBoi	I think im here
12:09	mouse	I think your here too..
12:09	frog	okay well duck said to start without him and we're running low on time so lets start
12:09		*** FishBoi quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
12:10	mouse	Looks like more connection issues?
12:10	frog	i guess
12:10		*** FishBoi joined #CS435zoo
12:10	frog	okay
12:10	frog	what did we accomplish this week?
12:11	FishBoi	We finished out senior projects!!! And i am in communication with mozilla with my bug
12:11	mouse	I've been attempting to figure out why the mouse isn't telling the debugger window its coordinates when you enter the console window.
12:12	mouse	I think this might be a better solution if I can figure out how to still move the vertical splitter even if you are in the console window.
12:12	frog	This week I finalized a bug I am going to investigate, I can't recreate it on my linux partition but that might be useful information so I will contribute that. I'm also having trouble recreating its "parent" bug, because the steps to reproduce don't work well in the debugger. It wants me to put a breakpoint at a ReactJs return statement,
12:13	frog	I don't seem to be able to, but I'm not sure if that in itself is a bug or if its how react is supposed to be handled
12:14	mouse	Yeah, I think learning about React might help everyone here...
12:14	frog	mouse yeah, when I looked at it with you the other day it seemed that the pointer coordinates were locked to one part of the window
12:15		*** FishBoi quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
12:15		*** FishBoi joined #CS435zoo
12:16	mouse	frog, the bug reporter said that it should stop moving the window as soon as you leave the debugger window but I disagree. I think you should be able to move the splitter regardless of where the pointer is..
12:17	frog	mouse I also disagree, I feel like that could potentially be a usability/accessibility issue. It might be worth looking up some accessibility documentation and see if you can find anything to support your point, and then add that to the discussion?
12:18	mouse	That's very good advice there frog. I think I will do that.
12:19	mouse	I'm trying to keep the coordinates of the pointer being fed to the splitter event while it's moving anywhere but I will settle for manually firing the mouseUp event so that it lets go of the splitter upon entering another window. That is if they don't want the former feature mentioned. 
12:19	frog	fair enough
12:20	frog	okay, what are we working on moving forward?
12:21	FishBoi	I am moving forward on finishing my weekly blog update, fixing my bug if i can, make it through the term, and take my dog on my walks!
12:22	frog	I am working on delving more into react, so I can potentially add something to the discussion on bugzilla. I will probably hit up the slack channel if I can't find anything on it by reading the documentation or info on react
12:22	mouse	I will look into my current bug and see if the issue raised here could be part of an accessibility issue and see what I can do about it..
12:22	mouse	I'm also planning on creating a gif of my issue and asking for help on Slack.
12:24	FishBoi	whats next?
12:24	frog	what are our impediments (speed round)
12:25	frog	my impediments are not knowing anything about how react js should work
12:25	mouse	Same here. I have a hard time understanding what's happening when I debug that files in React.
12:26	FishBoi	my impediments are needing to use the whole central bugzilla folder and trying to figure out all the things I need to download on linux to run it
12:26	frog	yeesh
12:26	frog	okay, I think that's it.
12:26	FishBoi	kool kool
12:26	mouse	sweet!
12:26	FishBoi	Have a great weekend my dudes
12:27	frog	see y'all tomorrow?
12:27	mouse	later!
